Integrated the ecommereceapi with docker and postgreSQL

1.First build the docker image file using docker-compose
    docker-compose up -d --build
2.Running commands within Docker is a little different than in a traditional Django project. For example, to migrate the new PostgreSQL database running in Docker.
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
